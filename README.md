#  VIC secondary schools scraper
 
**Introduction**

The task involved developing a web scraper to navigate [GoodSchools.com.au](https://www.goodschools.com.au) and collect data on secondary schools in Victoria. The objective was to extract specific information such as school names, sectors, geolocations, postcodes, and academic results, compiling this data into a structured CSV file for analysis.

**Approach and Tools**

To effectively scrape the required data, it was crucial to understand the website's structure and behavior:

-   **Dynamic Content**: The site loads some content via JavaScript.
-   **Pagination**: Schools are listed across multiple pages.
-   **Consistent HTML Structure**: School details are presented in a uniform format.

Given the dynamic nature of the content and the need to interact with pagination, **Selenium WebDriver** was chosen as the primary tool. Selenium allows for browser automation, enabling the scraper to render JavaScript and navigate through the site as a user would. For parsing the HTML content, **BeautifulSoup** was used due to its powerful parsing capabilities. **pandas** facilitated data storage and export, while **regular expressions** (`re` module) assisted in pattern matching for data extraction.

**Implementation Details**

1.  **Setup and Configuration**:

    -   **Constants** were defined for easy configuration:
        -   `HEADLESS_MODE`: Runs the browser in headless mode.
        -   `START_URL`: The initial URL for scraping.
        -   `MAX_SCHOOLS`: Maximum number of schools to scrape.
        -   `PAGE_LOAD_WAIT_TIME` and `DETAIL_PAGE_WAIT_TIME`: Wait times for page loads.
        -   `CSV_FILE_NAME`: Name of the output CSV file.
        -   `DEFAULT_VALUE`: Default value for missing data.
    -   **Selenium WebDriver** was initialized with Chrome in headless mode using `webdriver_manager` for driver management.
2.  **Navigating and Scraping**:

    -   The scraper navigates to the starting URL and waits for the page to load.
    -   A `while` loop continues scraping while there are schools to scrape and pages to navigate.
    -   **School Listings Extraction**:
        -   Uses BeautifulSoup to parse the page and find all school cards.
        -   Extracts the school name, sector, and detail page link from each card.
    -   **Detail Page Extraction**:
        -   Navigates to each school's detail page.
        -   Checks for a "Page not found" message to skip invalid pages.
        -   Extracts geolocation data and academic results.
3.  **Data Extraction and Handling**:

    -   **Geolocation and Postcode**:
        -   Extracted from `<span>` elements with specific classes.
        -   Multiple geolocations are joined into a comma-separated string.
        -   Postcodes are extracted using a regular expression matching the last four digits.
        -   If data is missing, default values are assigned.
    -   **Academic Results**:
        -   Extracted from the "Academic Results" section.
        -   Specific metrics like "Scores of 40+", "Median Score", "Satisfactory completions of VCE/VET" are captured.
        -   Missing data fields are filled with the default value.
4.  **Error and Edge Case Handling**:

    -   **Missing Pages**:
        -   Implemented a check for "Page not found" headers to skip schools with missing detail pages.
    -   **Exception Handling**:
        -   Used try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions without stopping the scraper.
        -   Ensured the scraper returns to the listings page after an error.
    -   **Data Consistency**:
        -   Default values are used for any missing fields to maintain a consistent data structure.
5.  **Data Storage and Export**:

    -   Collected data is stored in a list of dictionaries.
    -   Converted to a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
    -   Exported to a CSV file

**Challenges and Solutions**

-   **Dynamic Content Loading**:

    -   **Challenge**: JavaScript-rendered content is not accessible via static HTTP requests.
    -   **Solution**: Using Selenium to render pages as a browser would, ensuring all dynamic content is loaded.
-   **Pagination Handling**:

    -   **Challenge**: Navigating through multiple pages without losing track of the scraping progress.
    -   **Solution**: Identifying the 'Next' page link using BeautifulSoup and updating the loop accordingly.
-   **Error Handling**:

    -   **Challenge**: Unexpected page structures or missing data could cause the scraper to fail.
    -   **Solution**: Implementing robust exception handling and default values to gracefully skip problematic entries.
-   **Performance Considerations**:

    -   **Challenge**: Selenium can be slower and more resource-intensive than static scraping methods.
    -   **Solution**: Running in headless mode and optimizing wait times to balance speed and reliability.

**Limitations and Potential Improvements**

-   **Dependency on Site Structure**:

    -   The scraper relies on the current HTML structure of GoodSchools.com.au. Changes to the site's layout could break the scraper.
    -   **Improvement**: Implement more flexible selectors and consider using XPath expressions.
